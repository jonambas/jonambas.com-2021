Through building component libraries over the years, my team at SparkPost have created React components that are both hated and loved by our engineers. We noticed patterns and conventions that work, and some that don't.

The following is an attempt to document some of our opinions on these patterns, to ensure we're creating the best developer experience possible.

## Composition

Use `props.children` to enable component composition. This limits the API surface area of a component and allows prop naming to become more predictable.

<Code
  code={`
// Dont' do
<ActionList actions={[{ content: 'Content', onClick }]} />

<Avatar size="sm" fallbackColor="blue" imageSrc={src} imageAlt="Text" />
`} />

<Code
  code={`
// Do
<ActionList>
  <ActionList.Action onClick={onClick}>Content</ActionList.Action>
</ActionList>

<Avatar size="sm" color="blue">
  <Avatar.Image src={src} alt="Text" />
</Avatar>
`} />

## Native Attributes

Native attributes or common props, such as `className`, `id` or `onClick`, should not be renamed. Don't force your engineers to learn APIs they already know.

<Code
  code={`
// Don't do
const Component = (props) => {
  return (
    <div
      id={props.componentId}
      onClick={props.handleClick}
    />
  )
}
`}
/>

<Code
  code={`
// Do
const Component = (props) => {
  return <div {...props} />;
}
`}
/>

## Prop Consistency

Prop names and enumerable prop values with similar functionality across different components should be consistent.

<Code
  code={`
// Don't do
<Stack align="center" />
<Inline horizontalAlign="middle" />
`}
/>

<Code
  code={`
// Do
<Stack align="center" />
<Inline align="center" />
`}
/>

## Boolean Props

Boolean prop names should be chosen based on their **default value**. For example, a `disabled` prop on an `input` element, or an `open` prop on an overlay.

<Code
  code={`
// Don't do
<Popover closed={false} />
<Button enabled={false} />
`}
/>

<Code
  code={`
// Do
<Popover open />
<Button disabled />
`}
/>

## Enums vs Booleans

Always default to enums over booleans, when the variants or permutations are mutually exclusive. This allows you to add variants without introducing new props.

<Code
  code={`
// Don't do
<Text center /><Tag red />`}
/>

<Code
  code={`
// Do
<Text align="center" />
<Tag color="red" />
`}
/>

## Control

Stateful components, such as inputs or popovers, should always be able to be controlled through their APIs. For example, the state of a `Textfield` component could be controlled via `value` and `onChange` props, but should be able to function without them.

## Refs

Refs should always be forwarded, either to the outermost DOM element, or to the most applicable element of the component. For example form components should forward refs to `<input/>`.

<Code
  language="javascript"
  code={`
// Do
const Input = React.forwardRef(function Input(props, userRef) {
  return <input ref={userRef} />;
});
`}
/>

## Other Conventions to Avoid

Avoid render props (or children functions), and higher order components. If you need to pass state to a component, create a reusable hook instead.

<Code
  code={`
// Don't do
<Component>
  {(state) => <div />}
</Component>

<Component render={(state) => <div />} />
`} />

<Code
  language="javascript"
  code={`// Don't do
export default withState(Component);`}
/>
