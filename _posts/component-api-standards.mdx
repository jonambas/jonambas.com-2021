Through building component libraries over the years, my team at SparkPost have created React components that are both hated and loved by our engineers. We noticed patterns and conventions that work, and some that don't.

The following is an attempt to document some of our opinions on these patterns, to ensure we're creating the best developer experience possible.

## Composition

Using `props.children` is the preferred way of enabling component composition. In certain situations, to limit the number of composable permutations, it may be permissible to explicitly define a React node type prop.

<Code
  code={`
// Dont' do
<ActionList actions={[{ content: 'Content' }]} />
`}
/>

<Code
  code={`
// Do
<ActionList>
  <ActionList.Action>Content</ActionList.Action>
</ActionList>
// Also okay
<TextField suffix={<Icon />} helpText={<Help />} />
`}
/>

## Spreading

Component props should never be spread to an underlying DOM element directly without being picked or altered. This pollutes the DOM with unwanted and unknown props, and produces bugs.

<Code
  code={`
// Don't do
function MyComponent(props) {
  return (
    <div {...props} />
  )
}
`}
/>

## Native Attributes

Native attributes, such as `className` or `id`, should not be renamed. You could save time by avoiding documentation.

<Code
  code={`
// Don't do
function MyComponent(props) {
  const { class, componentId, handleClick } = props;
  return (
    <div
      className={class}
      id={componentId}
      onClick={handleClick}
    />
  )
}
`}
/>

<Code
  code={`
// Do
function MyComponent(props) {
  const { className, id, onClick } = props;
  return (
    <div
      className={className}
      id={id}
      onClick={onClick}
    />
  )
}
`}
/>

## Boolean Prop Naming

Boolean prop names should be chosen based on their **default value**. For example, a `disabled` prop on an `input` element, or an `open` prop on an overlay.

<Code
  code={`
// Don't do
<Popover closed={false} />
<Button enabled={false} />
`}
/>

<Code
  code={`
// Do
<Popover open />
<Button disabled />
`}
/>

## Prop Naming Consistency

Prop names and enumerable prop values with similar functionality across different components should be consistent.

<Code
  code={`
// Don't do
<Stack align="center" />
<Inline horizontalAlign="middle" />
`}
/>

<Code
  code={`
// Do
<Stack align="center" />
<Inline align="center" />
`}
/>

## Enums vs Booleans

Always default to enums over booleans, when the variants or permutations are mutually exclusive.

<Code
  code={`
// Don't do
<Text center /><Tag red />`}
/>

<Code
  code={`
// Do
<Text textAlign="center" />
<Tag color="red" />
`}
/>

## Control

Controlled `input` components should be controlled via `value` and `onChange` props.

Controlled components should always be able to function in an uncontrolled manner, when `value` is not provided. Default state should be configured via `defaultValue`.

## Refs

Refs should always be forwarded, either to the outermost DOM element, or to the most applicable element of the component. For example form components should forward refs to `<input/>`.

<Code
  language="javascript"
  code={`
// Do
const MyInput = React.forwardRef(function MyInput(props, userRef) {
  return (
    <div>
      <input ref={userRef} />
    </div>
  )
})
`}
/>

## Avoid renderThing Methods

Avoid methods that produce JSX markup separately from a components return statement. This typically means that the render method can be abstracted to a separate component.

<Code
  code={`// Don't do
function MyComponent() {
  const thingOne = React.useMemo(() => <div>render a thing </div>, []);
  const renderThingTwo = () => <div>render another thing</div>;
  return (
    <div>
      {thingOne}
      {renderThingTwo()}
    </div>
  );
} `}
/>

<Code
  language="jsx"
  code={`// Do
function MyComponent() {
return (
  <div>
    <ThingOne />
    <ThingTwo />
  </div>
  );
} `}
/>

## Other Conventions to Avoid

Avoid render props (or children functions), and higher order components. If you need to pass state to a component, create a reusable hook instead.

<Code
  code={`
// Don't do
<Component>
  {(state) => (
    <div />
  )}
</Component>

<Component render={(state) => <div />} />
`} />

<Code
  language="javascript"
  code={`// Don't do
export default withState(Component);`}
/>
